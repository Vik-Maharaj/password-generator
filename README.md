# Vik's Password Generator

## Description

Online security is a big deal! For people with access to sensitive information, securing that information is a critial part of working online. And in order to provide adequate security, sometimes information needs to be protected with a strong, unbreakable password.

Enter the purpose of this project: to create an application that generates a random passowrd based on user-selected length and character criteria. The goal was to create a simple, straightforward app that operates in the browser, has a clean and simple interface, and can be accessed from anywhere.

The achieve this goal, the following were accomplished as part of the application: 

- customize html and css elements for page to accept user inputs
- present the user with a prompt asking for their desired length of password (between 8 and 128 characters)
- present the user with a series of prompts asking the user for their desired critera for the characters they want included in the password 
- ensure that the user is not able to enter the wrong or incorrect prompts
- generate a unique password based on the user inputs that is written to the page for the user

After accomplishing those aspects of the application the user can simply, and in just a matter of moments, generate their own unique password of their desired length and character-inclusion.
